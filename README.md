# Now a clean readme

## Notes

### Bibliography (`papers.bib`)

- All publications are managed in `_bibliography/papers.bib`
- `assets/bibliography/papers.bib` is a copy used for the "Download BibTeX" button on the publications page
- **These are kept in sync automatically** by `_plugins/copy-bib.rb`, which runs on every Jekyll build
- You do NOT need to manually update `assets/bibliography/papers.bib` — just edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and build/deploy
