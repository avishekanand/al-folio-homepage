  Automated fact checking has gained immense interest to tackle the growing
misinformation in the digital era. Existing systems primarily focus on
synthetic claims on Wikipedia, and noteworthy progress has also been made on
real-world claims. In this work, we release Numtemp, a diverse, multi-domain
dataset focused exclusively on numerical claims, encompassing temporal,
statistical and diverse aspects with fine-grained metadata and an evidence
collection without leakage. This addresses the challenge of verifying
real-world numerical claims, which are complex and often lack precise
information, not addressed by existing works that mainly focus on synthetic
claims. We evaluate and quantify the limitations of existing solutions for the
task of verifying numerical claims. We also evaluate claim decomposition based
methods, numerical understanding based models and our best baselines achieves a
macro-F1 of 58.32. This demonstrates that Numtemp serves as a challenging
evaluation set for numerical claim verification.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
