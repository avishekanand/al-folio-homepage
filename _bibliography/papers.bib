  abstract = {Dual-encoder-based dense retrieval models have become the standard in IR. They employ large Transformer-based language models, which are notoriously inefficient in terms of resources and latency. We propose Fast-Forward indexes -- vector forward indexes which exploit the semantic matching capabilities of dual-encoder models for efficient and effective re-ranking. Our framework enables re-ranking at very high retrieval depths and combines the merits of both lexical and semantic matching via score interpolation. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the limitations of dual-encoders, we tackle two main challenges: Firstly, we improve computational efficiency by either pre-computing representations, avoiding unnecessary computations altogether, or reducing the complexity of encoders. This allows us to considerably improve ranking efficiency and latency. Secondly, we optimize the memory footprint and maintenance cost of indexes; we propose two complementary techniques to reduce the index size and show that, by dynamically dropping irrelevant document tokens, the index maintenance efficiency can be improved substantially. We perform evaluation to show the effectiveness and efficiency of Fast-Forward indexes -- our method has low latency and achieves competitive results without the need for hardware acceleration, such as GPUs.},

  abstract = {Contextual ranking models have delivered impressive performance improvements over classical models in the document ranking task. However, these highly over-parameterized models tend to be data-hungry and require large amounts of data even for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose data-augmentation methods for effective and robust ranking performance. One of the key benefits of using data augmentation is in achieving sample efficiency or learning effectively when we have only a small amount of training data. We propose supervised and unsupervised data augmentation schemes by creating training data using parts of the relevant documents in the query-document pairs. We then adapt a family of contrastive losses for the document ranking task that can exploit the augmented data to learn an effective ranking model. Our extensive experiments on subsets of the MS MARCO and TREC-DL test sets show that data augmentation, along with the ranking-adapted contrastive losses, results in performance improvements under most dataset sizes. Apart from sample efficiency, we conclusively show that data augmentation results in robust models when transferred to out-of-domain benchmarks. Our performance improvements in in-domain and more prominently in out-of-domain benchmarks show that augmentation regularizes the ranking model and improves its robustness and generalization capability.},

  abstract = {Neural ranking models have become increasingly popular for real-world search and recommendation systems in recent years. Unlike their tree-based counterparts, neural models are much less interpretable. That is, it is very difficult to understand their inner workings and answer questions like how do they make their ranking decisions? or what document features do they find important? This is particularly disadvantageous since interpretability is highly important for real-world systems. In this work, we explore feature selection for neural learning-to-rank (LTR). In particular, we investigate six widely-used methods from the field of interpretable machine learning (ML) and introduce our own modification, to select the input features that are most important to the ranking behavior. To understand whether these methods are useful for practitioners, we further study whether they contribute to efficiency enhancement. Our experimental results reveal a large feature redundancy in several LTR benchmarks: the local selection method TabNet can achieve optimal ranking performance with less than 10 features; the global methods, particularly our G-L2X, require slightly more selected features, but exhibit higher potential in improving efficiency. We hope that our analysis of these feature selection methods will bring the fields of interpretable ML and LTR closer together.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their unparalleled ability to perform various natural language processing tasks. These models, benefiting from their advanced natural language understanding capabilities, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance. However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations. Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that require a temporal understanding. We pay particular attention to handling factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets. Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for rather new information. In manual and automatic testing, we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA performance deteriorates. Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks.},

  abstract = {Pre-trained contextual language models such as BERT, GPT, and XLnet work quite well for document retrieval tasks. Such models are fine-tuned based on the query-document/query-passage level relevance labels to capture the ranking signals. However, the documents are longer than the passages and such document ranking models suffer from the token limitation (512) of BERT. Researchers proposed ranking strategies that either truncate the documents beyond the token limit or chunk the documents into units that can fit into the BERT. In the later case, the relevance labels are either directly transferred from the original query-document pair or learned through some external model. In this paper, we conduct a detailed study of the design decisions about splitting and label transfer on retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. We find that direct transfer of relevance labels from documents to passages introduces label noise that strongly affects retrieval effectiveness for large training datasets. We also find that query processing times are adversely affected by fine-grained splitting schemes. As a remedy, we propose a careful passage level labelling scheme using weak supervision that delivers improved performance (3–14% in terms of nDCG score) over most of the recently proposed models for ad-hoc retrieval while maintaining manageable computational complexity on four diverse document retrieval datasets.},

  abstract = {Neural document ranking models perform impressively well due to superior language understanding gained from pre-training tasks. However, due to their complexity and large number of parameters, these (typically transformer-based) models are often non-interpretable in that ranking decisions can not be clearly attributed to specific parts of the input documents.
In this paper we propose ranking models that are inherently interpretable by generating explanations as a by-product of the prediction decision. We introduce the Select-and-Rank paradigm for document ranking, where we first output an explanation as a selected subset of sentences in a document. Thereafter, we solely use the explanation or selection to make the prediction, making explanations first-class citizens in the ranking process. Technically, we treat sentence selection as a latent variable trained jointly with the ranker from the final output. To that end, we propose an end-to-end training technique for Select-and-Rank models utilizing reparameterizable subset sampling using the Gumbel-max trick.
We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach is competitive to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is broadly applicable to numerous ranking tasks and furthers the goal of building models that are interpretable by design. Finally, we present real-world applications that benefit from our sentence selection method.},

However, it is still unclear as to whether contextual models understand well-established notions of relevance that are central to IR. In this paper, we use probing, a recent approach used to analyze language models, to investigate the ranking abilities of BERT-based rankers. Most of the probing literature has focussed on linguistic and knowledge-aware capabilities of models or axiomatic analysis of ranking models. In this paper, we fill an important gap in the information retrieval literature by conducting a layer-wise probing analysis using four probes based on lexical matching, semantic similarity as well as linguistic properties like coreference resolution and named entity recognition. Our experiments show an interesting trend that BERT-rankers better encode ranking abilities at intermediate layers. Based on our observations, we train a ranking model by augmenting the ranking data with the probe data to show initial yet consistent performance improvements.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach towards better interpretability of a trained text-based ranking model in a post-hoc manner. A popular approach for post-hoc interpretability text ranking models are based on locally approximating the model behavior using a simple ranker. Since rankings have multiple relevance factors and are aggregations of predictions, existing approaches that use a single ranker might not be sufficient to approximate a complex model, resulting in low fidelity. In this paper, we overcome this problem by considering multiple simple rankers to better approximate the entire ranking list from a black-box ranking model. We pose the problem of local approximation as a GENERALIZED PREFERENCE COVERAGE (GPC) problem that incorporates multiple simple rankers towards the listwise explanation of ranking models. Our method MULTIPLEX uses a linear programming approach to judiciously extract the explanation terms, so that to explain the entire ranking list. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of ranking models and report fidelity improvements of 37%–54% over existing competitors. We finally compare explanations in terms of multiple relevance factors and topic aspects to better understand the logic of ranking decisions, showcasing our explainers’ practical utility.},

  abstract = {Configurable software systems have become increasingly popular as they enable customized software variants. The main challenge in dealing with configuration problems is that the number of possible configurations grows exponentially as the number of features increases. Therefore, algorithms for testing customized software have to deal with the challenge of tractably finding potentially faulty configurations given exponentially large configurations. To overcome this problem, prior works focused on sampling strategies to significantly reduce the number of generated configurations, guaranteeing a high t-wise coverage. In this work, we address the configuration sampling problem by proposing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based sampler that efficiently finds the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, allowing for the efficient identification of a minimal subset of configurations that covers all t-wise feature interactions while minimizing redundancy. We also present the CS-Gym, an environment for the configuration sampling. We benchmark our results against heuristic-based sampling methods on eight different feature models of software product lines and show that our method outperforms all sampling methods in terms of sample size. Our findings indicate that the achieved improvement has major implications for cost reduction, as the reduction in sample size results in fewer configurations that need to be tested.

  abstract = {Query rewriting refers to an established family of approaches that are applied to underspecified and ambiguous queries to overcome the vocabulary mismatch problem in document ranking. Queries are typically rewritten during query processing time for better query modelling for the downstream ranker. With the advent of large- language models (LLMs), there have been initial investigations into using generative approaches to generate pseudo documents to tackle this inherent vocabulary gap. In this work, we analyze the utility of LLMs for improved query rewriting for text ranking tasks.
We find that there are two inherent limitations of using LLMs as query re-writers – concept drift when using only queries as prompts and large inference costs during query processing. We adopt a simple, yet surprisingly effective, approach called context aware query rewriting (CAR) to leverage the benefits of LLMs for query understanding. Firstly, we rewrite ambiguous training queries by context-aware prompting of LLMs, where we use only relevant documents as context. Unlike existing approaches, we use LLM- based query rewriting only during the training phase. Eventually, a ranker is fine-tuned on the rewritten queries instead of the original queries during training. In our extensive experiments, we find that fine-tuning a ranker using re-written queries offers a significant improvement of up to 33% on the passage ranking task and up to 28% on the document ranking task when compared to the baseline performance of using original queries.},

  abstract = {As algorithms are increasingly augmenting and substituting human decision-making, understanding how the introduction of computational agents changes the fundamentals of human behavior becomes vital. This pertains to not only users, but also those parties who face the consequences of an algorithmic decision. In a controlled experiment with 480 participants, we exploit an extended version of two-player ultimatum bargaining where responders choose to bargain with either another human, another human with an AI decision aid or an autonomous AI-system acting on behalf of a passive human proposer. Our results show strong responder preferences against the algorithm, as most responders opt for a human opponent and demand higher compensation to reach a contract with autonomous agents. To map these preferences to economic expectations, we elicit incentivized subject beliefs about their opponent’s behavior. The majority of responders maximize their expected value when this is line with approaching the human proposer. In contrast, responders predicting income maximization for the autonomous AI-system overwhelmingly override economic self-interest to avoid the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Quality control is essential for creating extractive question answering (EQA) datasets via crowdsourcing. Aggregation across answers, i.e. word spans within passages annotated, by different crowd workers is one major focus for ensuring its quality. However, crowd workers cannot reach a consensus on a considerable portion of questions. We introduce a simple yet effective answer aggregation method that takes into account the relations among the answer, question, and context passage. We evaluate answer quality from both the view of question answering model to determine how confident the QA model is about each answer and the view of the answer verification model to determine whether the answer is correct. Then we compute aggregation scores with each answer’s quality and its contextual embedding produced by pre-trained language models. The experiments on a large real crowdsourced EQA dataset show that our framework outperforms baselines by around 16% on precision and effectively conduct answer aggregation for extractive QA task.},
