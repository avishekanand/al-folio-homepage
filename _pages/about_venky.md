**Venktesh Vishwanathan**

I am a postdoctoral researcher in WIS group at TU Delft.
My research lies at the intersection of Natural language processing and Information retrieval, primarily concerning robust generative and retrieval pipelines for solving knowledge intensive tasks like complex QA and complex fact checking. My work involves building challenging benchmarks for these tasks and solving them. [Homepage](https://venkteshv.github.io/#home)
