**Jonas Wallat**


I'm Jonas and I work with Avishek on interpretability and robustness of LLMs. The main goal is understanding how information is processed and making sure the LLMs do so reliably. 



Research interests:

	- Mechanistic interpretability
    - QA & IR
    - Robustness of Deep Learning models
